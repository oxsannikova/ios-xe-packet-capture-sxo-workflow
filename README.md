To successfully inport this workflow you need to configure the following:
1. Configure Webex Teams Bot and have the token ready to submit when asked during import.
> You can also use your personal Webex Teams Token. Note that it expires every 12 hours.

2. Webex Teams Room ID where you want all the communications go to. 
> Additional logic can be added to search by room name and save the room id. Not currently part of this workflow.
